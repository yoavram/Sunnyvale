% Introduction
\section*{Introduction}

Important modes of cultural transmission are vertical (from parent to offspring), horizontal (between peers), and oblique (from non-parental adults to offspring) transmission. 
\citet[ch.~3]{Cavalli-Sforza1981} first introduced models in which a specific trait is transmitted either vertically or obliquely.
Mathematical models of cultural evolution may include one or more modes of cultural transmission and in most of these models the mode of transmission by individuals is fixed. 
For example, \cite{Aoki2005} and \citet{McElreath2008} focused on competition between individual learning, innate learning, and social learning; \citet{Fogarty2017} compared the effects of different oblique mechanisms (random, success-biased, best-of-k, one-to-many) on the cultural richness and diversity of the population; and \citet{Aoki2012} modeled scenarios in which individual and social learning occur during separate stages in life.

Many of these models included fluctuating selection envisaged as due to environmental changes~\citep[reviewed in][]{Aoki2014}. 
We recently studied a model in which each individual can learn a dichotomous phenotype either from a parent, with probability $\rho$, or from a non-parental adult, with probability $1-\rho$ (\autoref{fig:transmission}).
We found that if selection fluctuates between favoring each of the two phenotypes, but on average favored both phenotypes for similar time periods, then a phenotypic polymorphism may be maintained~\citep{Ram2018}.
Furthermore, we found that if the environment changes very rapidly then lower $\rho$ values are likely to evolve, that is, oblique transmission is favored over vertical transmission.

There has been much less theory developed for fluctuating transmission.
Nevertheless, if we assume that social learning can be affected by ecological and demographic factors, such as the frequency of interactions~\citep{VanSchaik2003}, weather~\citep{Phithakkitnukoon2012}, population size or density~\citep{Fischer2015,Aureli1997a}, or stress~\citep{Farine2015}, then it is reasonable that the mode and rate of transmission will fluctuate over time.
For example, \citet{Webster2008} have demonstrated that minnows (small freshwater shoaling fish), increase their reliance on social learning when predation risk increases.
%For example, it may be the case that during cold seasons offspring are more likely to stay close to their parents and therefore learn vertically, whereas during warm seasons they are more likely to wander and interact with other adults and therefore learn obliquely.

Here, we analyze a model in which individuals learn from their parents with probability $\rho$ (vertical transmission), and from non-parental adults with probability $1-\rho$ (oblique transmission), where $\rho$ fluctuates over time~(\autoref{fig:transmission}).
We find that $\ldots$ (to be continued)  %TODO
We suggest that cultural evolution can be affected by environmental changes via both selection and transmission fluctuations, and that further empirical and theoretical studies are required to disentangle these effects.

% Model & Results
\section*{Model \& Results}

Consider a very large population whose members are characterized by a single dichotomous cultural trait with phenotypes $A$ and $B$ and fitness values $w_A=1+s$ and $w_B=1$, respectively.
Phenotypes are transmitted vertically with probability $\rho$ or obliquely with probability $1-\rho$~(\autoref{fig:transmission}).
Given $x$ the frequency of phenotype $A$ at the current generation, the frequency of $A$ in the next generation is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:recurrence}
x' = \rho \frac{1+s}{\overline w} x + (1-\rho)x,
\end{equation}
where $\overline w = 1 + xs$ is the population mean fitness.

% Periodic fluctuating transmission
\subsection*{Periodic fluctuating transmission}

Suppose that the vertical transmission rate $\rho$ is fluctuating, such that $\rho = \rho_1$ in odd generations and $\rho = \rho_2$ in even generations.
From \eqref{eq:recurrence}, the recurrence equations for two generations is then
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned} \label{eq:recurrence_two_generations}
x' = \rho_1 \frac{1+s}{\overline w} x + (1-\rho_1)x, \\
x'' = \rho_2 \frac{1+s}{\overline w} x' + (1-\rho_2)x'.
\end{aligned}\end{equation}

First, fixations of $A$ and $B$ ($x^*=1$ and $x^*=0$, respectively) are both equilibria, as they solve $x''=x$.
Second, when $s>0$ ($s<0$) because $x'/x = 1+\frac{\rho_1 s (1-x)}{1+sx} > 1$ ($<1$) and $x''/x' = 1+\frac{\rho_2 s (1-x')}{1+sx'} > 1$ ($<1$), the frequency of $A$ ($B$) increases every generation and $x^*=1$ ($x^*=0$) is globally stable.
Therefore, we find that fluctuations in the mode of transmission ($\rho$) without fluctuations in selection lead to fixation of the favored phenotype without any stable polymorphisms.

% Periodic fluctuating transmission and selection
\subsection*{Periodic fluctuating transmission and selection}

Now suppose that both the vertical transmission rate $\rho$ and the selection coefficient $s$ fluctuate together, so that when $A$ is favored the transmission rate is $\rho_A$, and when $B$ is favored the transmission rate is $\rho_B$.
The change in the frequency $x$ of phenotype $A$ when either $A$ or $B$ is favored is described by $F_A(x)$ and $F_B(x)$, respectively,
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned} \label{eq:recurrence_periodic_fluc}
F_A(x) = \rho_A \frac{1+s}{1+sx} x + (1-\rho_A)x, \\
F_B(x) = \rho_B \frac{1}{1+s-sx} x' + (1-\rho_B)x.
\end{aligned}\end{equation}

\paragraph{Symmetric periods -- $AkBk$.}
We first consider environments which periodically fluctuate between favoring $A$ and $B$ every $k$ generations.
Using a linear approximation, fixations of $A$ ($x^*=1$) and $B$ ($x^*=0$) are locally stable if, respectively,
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\big[F'_A(1) F'_B(1)\big]^k < 1, \\
\big[F'_A(0) F'_B(0)\big]^k < 1. \\
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
and if both of these conditions are not met then there exists a \emph{protected polymorphism}.
So for a protected polymorphism we require
\begin{equation}
1 < F'_A(1) F'_B(1) = \Big(1-\rho_A\frac{s}{1+s}\Big)\Big(1+\rho_B s\Big) 
= 1-\frac{1}{1+s}\big[\rho_B(1+s-\rho_A)-\rho_A\big],
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
1 < F'_A(0) F'_B(0) = \Big(1+\rho_A s\Big)\Big(1-\rho_B \frac{s}{1+s}\Big) 
= 1+\frac{s}{1+s}\big[\rho_A(1+s) -\rho_B(1+\rho_A s)\big],
\end{equation}
which can be summarized as a condition on $\rho_B$,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:poly_condition_periodic_fluc}
\frac{\rho_A}{1+s(1-\rho_A)} < \rho_B < \frac{(1+s)\rho_A}{1+s\rho_A},
\end{equation}
or as a condition on the difference between $\rho_B$ and $\rho_A$
\begin{equation}
-s\rho_B(1-\rho_A) < \rho_B - \rho_A < s\rho_A(1-\rho_B).
\end{equation}
Surprisingly, the stronger selection is, the larger the difference can be that still allows a stable polymorphism.

\paragraph{Period of one -- $A1B1$.}
In the case of $k=1$ we can find $x^*$ the frequency of $A$ at the protected polymorphism.
Denote $F_B(F_A(x))-x = G(x) \cdot x (1-x) \cdot \gamma$ with
\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \label{eq:xstar_periodic_fluc_k=1}
G(x) &= ax^2+bx+c, \\
\gamma &= -\frac{1 + sx}{s} \Big[ 1 + s + s^2 x (1-\rho)(1+x)\Big], \\
a &= s^2 \rho_A (1-\rho_A) (1 - \rho_B + \rho_B/\rho_A)) > 0, \\
b &= s(1-\rho_A)(2\rho_B - s\rho_A(1-\rho_B)), \\
c &= \rho_B - \rho_A - s\rho_A(1-\rho_B),
\end{aligned} \end{equation}
% $a+b+c>0$.
then $x^*$ is a solution of the quadratic $G(x)=0$. %, given by $x^* = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.
The condition \eqref{eq:poly_condition_periodic_fluc}, which guarantees that $0 < x^* < 1$, is equivalent to $c<0$, and therefore it also guarantees that $\sqrt{b^2-4ac} > b$.
So, if $0<s<1$ (such that $b$ is guaranteed to be positive given LHS of eq.~\ref{eq:poly_condition_periodic_fluc}), then 
\begin{equation}
x^*= \frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
\end{equation}
\autoref{fig:rho1_rho2_phase_k=1} shows $x^*$, highlighting the area of the parameter space in which a protected polymorphism exists. The figure demonstrates that the stronger selection is (x-axis), the greater the fluctuations in $\rho$ can be (y-axis) while still maintaining a polymorphic population (area between the dashed lines).

%\begin{align}
%G(0) = c > 0  \Leftrightarrow \rho_B > \frac{\rho_A(1+s)}{1+\rho_As}, \\
%G'(0) = b > 0 \Leftrightarrow \rho_B > \frac{\rho_A s}{2 + \rho_As}, \\
%G(1) = a + b + c = (1+s)[\rho_B - \rho_A + s \rho_B (1-\rho_A)], \\
%G'(1) = 2a + b = s(1-\rho_A)(2(1+s)\rho_B + s\rho_A(1-\rho_B)) > 0.

Here, $\rho_A=0.5$.}
\label{fig:rho1_rho2_phase_k=1}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Asymmetric period -- $AkBl$.}
In the more general case, phenotype $A$ is favored for $k$ generations and phenotype $B$ for $l$ generations, and the transmission rate follows the same cycle such that $\rho=\rho_A$ when $A$ is favored and $\rho=\rho_B$ when $B$ is favored.
The requirements for a protected polymorphism are now
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
1 &< (F'_A(0))^k (F'_B(0))^l = a^k \big(b - (\rho_B - \rho_A) s/(1+s)\big)^l,\\
1 &< (F'_A(1))^k (F'_B(1))^l = b^k (a + (\rho_B - \rho_A) s)^l,
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
where $a=1+\rho_A s>1$, $b=1-\rho_A\frac{s}{1+s}<1$, and $\Delta \rho = \rho_B - \rho_A$.
This leads to a condition similar to eq.~20 in~\citet{Ram2018}, but more complex due to the addition of $\Delta \rho$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:poly_condition_periodic_fluc_k_l}
\frac{-\log{b}}{\log{\big(a + s \Delta \rho \big)}} < 
\frac{l}{k} < 
\frac{\log{a}}{-\log{\big(b - s \Delta \rho/(1+s)\big)}}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, increasing the vertical transmission rate specifically when $B$ is favored decreases the environmental period ratio $l/k$ that permits protected polymorphism; decreasing $\rho_B$  will have the opposite effect, increasing the ratio $l/k$ that permits a protected polymorphism.

% Randomly fluctuating transmission and selection
\subsection*{Randomly fluctuating transmission and selection}

We now allow both transmission and selection to fluctuate randomly.
Rewrite eq.~28 from \citet{Ram2018} so that $\rho$ is also a random variable
\begin{equation}
x_t = x_t \frac{1 + \rho_t s_t + x_t (1 - \rho_t) s_t}{1 + x_t s_t},
\end{equation}
where $s_t$ are i.i.d (independent and identically distributed), $Pr(-1+C<s_t<D)=1$ for some positive $C$ and $D$, $\rho_t$ are i.i.d, and  $0<\rho_t<1$ ($t=0,1,2,\ldots$).
Therefore, $z_t = \rho_t s_t$  are independent and identically distributed and $P(-1+C < z_t < D)$, and from Results~6 and 7 of \citet{Ram2018} we have:
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose $E[log(1+\rho_t s_t)]>0$. Then $x^*=0$ is not stochastically locally stable and in fact $P(lim_{t \to \infty} x_t=0) = 0$, i.e., fixation of $B$ almost surely does not occur.
\item Suppose $E[log(1+\rho_t s_t)]<0$. Then $x^*=0$ is stochastically locally stable. 
\item Similarly, if $E[log(1-\rho_t s_t/(1+s_t)]<0$, then $x^*=1$ is stochastically locally stable, and if $E[log(1-\rho_t s_t/(1+s_t))]>0$, then fixation of $A$ almost surely does not occur.
\item In particular, if $E[\rho_t s_t] = cov(\rho_t, s_t) + E[\rho_t] E[s_t] \le 0$ then $x^*=0$ is stochastically locally stable, and similarly if $E[-\rho_t s_t/(1+s_t)] = cov(\rho_t, -s_t/(1+s_t)) - E[\rho_t] E[s_t/(1+s_t)] \le 0$ then $x^*=1$ is stochastically locally stable.
\item It is not possible that $E[log(1+\rho_t s_t)]$ and $E[log(1-\rho_t s_t/(1+s_t)]$ are both negative, as their sum is positive
\begin{multline}
E[log(1+\rho_t s_t)] + E[log(1-\rho_t s_t/(1+s_t)] = \\
E[log(1+\rho_t s_t) + log(1-\rho_t s_t/(1+s_t)]= \\
E[log\big((1+\rho_t s_t)(1-\rho_t s_t/(1+s_t)\big)]= \\
E[log\big( 1+\rho_t(1-\rho_t)s_t^2/(1+s_t) \big)] > 0,
\end{multline}
and therefore it is not possible that both fixations are stochastically locally stable.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Examples.}
First, if $s_t$ and $\rho_t$ are independent ($cov(s_t, \rho_t)=0$) and $s_t$ is symmetric around zero, then $E[\rho_t s_t]=0$ and $E[-\rho_t s_t/(1+s_t)]>0$ (because $E[s_t/(1+s_t)] < E[s_t]$).
Therefore, fixation of $B$ is stochastically locally stable and fixation of $A$ almost surely does not occur.
For example, let $s_t \sim U(-1, 1)$ and $\rho_t \sim U(0,1)$ independently (in particular, $cov(\rho_t, s_t)=0$), then $E[log(1+\rho_t s_t)]\approx -0.07315$ and $E[log(1-\rho_t s_t/(1+s_t))]\approx 0.2337$.

However, note that symmetry of $s_t$ around zero provides an advantage to phenotype $B$: using Jensen's inequality, $E[w_A/w_B] = E[1+s_t] = 1 \le E[1/(1+s_t)] = E[w_B/w_A]$.
Therefore, if we take the i.i.d fitness random variables for $A$ and $B$ to be $w_{A,t}, w_{B,t} \sim U(0,1)$, respectively, and define $s_t=(w_{A,t}-w_{B,t})/w_{B,t}$, then neither $A$ nor $B$ has an advantage, on average (i.e. $E[w_{A,t}/w_{B,t}]=E[w_{B,t}/w_{A,t}]$, see \autoref{fig:beta}A), and both $E[\rho_t s_t]$ and $E[-\rho_t s_t/(1+s_t)]$ are positive, so that both fixations are not stochastically locally stable, and we expect the population to converge to a polymorphic distribution.

Second, if $s_t$ and $\rho_t$ are not independent such that $cov(\rho_t, s_t) \ne 0$, we can get fixation.
Let $w_{A,t}, w_{B,t} \sim U(0,1)$, $s_t=(w_{A,t}-w_{B,t})/w_{B,t}$ and $\rho_t \sim Beta(1+s_t, 1)$ (a beta distribution with parameters $1+s_t$ and $1$). 
The covariance of $s_t$ and $\rho_t$ is positive ($cov(s_t, \rho_t) \approx 4$; estimated by averaging $10^8$ random values of $s_t$ and $\rho_t$); that is, vertical transmission is more likely when $A$ is favored (i.e. $s_t>0$) and oblique transmission is more  likely when $B$ is favored (i.e. $s_t<0$; \autoref{fig:beta}).
Then $E[log(1+\rho_t s_t)] >0$ and $B$ almost surely doesn't fix, and $E[log(1-\rho_t s_t / (1+s_t)] < 0$, so fixation of $A$ is stochastically locally stable.
The opposite occurs if $\rho_t \sim \beta(1, 1+s_t)$ and the covariance of $s_t$ and $\rho_t$ is negative ($cov(s_t, \rho_t) \approx -4$). In that case, fixation of $B$ is stochastically locally stable and $A$ almost surely doesn't fix.

\label{fig:beta}
\end{figure*}

Third, it is also possible that both fixations are not stochastically locally stable even if $s_t$ and $\rho_t$ covary, but, as in the case of periodic fluctuations, this can only occur if the fluctuations in $\rho_t$ are small.
For example, \autoref{fig:rho1_rho2_stoch_p} shows the expected outcome when $s_t=s$ and $\rho_t=\rho_1$ with probability $p=0.505$ and $s_t=-s$ and $\rho_t=\rho_2$ with probability $1-p=0.495$.
The blue and red areas denote expected fixation of $A$ and $B$, respectively (i.e. stochastic local stability) and the white area shows expected polymorphism (neither fixation is stochastically locally stable).

The diagonal represents the case of no transmission fluctuations; \citet[Fig.~2]{Ram2018} demonstrated that with a constant transmission rate $\rho=0.1$ and the above distribution of $s_t$, both fixations are not stochastically stable.

% TODO full correlation between rho and s?

% Finite population size
\subsection*{Finite population size}

To include the effects of random genetic drift due to finite population size in the above deterministic model, we follow \citet{Ram2018} and develop a diffusion equation approximation.
In~\citet{Ram2018} only selection fluctuated via $s_t$, but here we also let transmission to fluctuate via $\rho_t$. 

We find a result similar to Result 11 from~\citet{Ram2018}:
The mean $\mu(x)$ and variance $\sigma^2(x)$ of the change in the frequency $x$ of phenotype $A$ in the case of a cycling environment $AkBl$, where $k+l=n$, are
\begin{equation} \label{eq:drift_diffusion_terms}
\mu(x) = S_n x(1-x)
\quad \text{and} \quad
\sigma^2(x) = n x (1-x),
\end{equation}
where $S_n = \sum_{t=1}^{n}{\rho_t s_t}$.
Furthermore, combining \eqref{eq:drift_diffusion_terms} with eqs.~46-47 from \citep{Ram2018}, we find that the fixation probability of phenotype $A$, starting with frequency $x$ of phenotype $A$, is
\begin{equation}
u(x) = \frac{1 - e^{-2 \frac{S_n}{n} x}}{1 - e^{-2 \frac{S_n}{n}}}.
\end{equation}
From Result 10 in \citep{Ram2018}, $u(x)$ is monotone increasing in $S_n/n$ which is the average selection coefficient of $A$ weighted by the vertical transmission rates $\rho_t$.
Therefore, if $s_t$ and $\rho_t$ are positively (negatively) correlated, $S_n/n$ increases (decreases), and the fixation probability $u(x)$ increases (decreases). 
This occurs because selection only affects those individuals that transmit their phenotype to their own offspring (i.e. vertically), and a fraction $1-\rho_t$ of the population individuals is effectively masked (for better or worse) from selection at each generation.

% Fluctuations in space
\subsection*{Fluctuations in space}

We now describe a model in which fluctuations in selection and transmission occur in space, rather then time; that is, we model a population divided to two demes.
Selection (e.g. reproduction) and transmission (e.g. learning, development) occur within the demes, followed by migration of sub-adults -- individuals that already acquired their phenotype but have yet to reproduce.
The frequency of phenotype $A$ in deme $j$ is marked by $x_j$, and therefore after selection and transmission the frequencies are 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:migration_model_selection_transmission}
x_j' = \rho_j \frac{w_j}{\overline{w}_j} x_j + (1-\rho_j) x_j,
\end{equation}
where $w_j$ is the fitness of phenotype $A$ in deme $j$ relative to the fitness of phenotype $B$; $\overline{w}_j=w_j x_j + (1-x_j)$ is the population mean fitness in deme $j$; and $\rho_j$ is the vertical transmission rate in deme $j$.

Following migration, the frequencies of $A$ in the two demes are
\begin{equation} \label{eq:migration_model}
\begin{aligned}
x_1'' = (1-m_1) x_1' + m_2 x_2', \\
x_2'' = m_1 x_1' + (1-m_2) x_2',
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $m_j$ is the migration rate out of deme $j$. 

\autoref{fig:migration} shows the stable frequencies of phenotype $A$ (i.e. the frequencies that solve $x_1=x_1''$ and $x_2=x_2''$) and the stable population mean fitnesses in the two demes with symmetric selection such that $A$ is favored in deme 1 and $B$ is favored in deme 2 with similar intensities (see figure legend).
Notably, without oblique transmission (left column), migration decreases the differences between the demes and reduces the population mean fitnesses.
With some oblique transmission, but equal in both demes, results are similar (not shown).
However, if oblique transmission is stronger in deme 2 compared to deme 1 (middle and right columns), the stable frequency of $A$ increases in both demes.
Therefore, the mean fitness in deme 1 decreases to a lesser extend than in deme 2, and even increases when the migration rate is high enough.
Furthermore, the polymorphism that is protected when transmission rates are equal disappears when transmission rates differ and migration is strong enough, and phenotype $A$ fixes (see right side of right column).

Models of cultural transmission mostly assume a fixed relative rate at which different modes of transmission -- vertical, horizontal, or oblique -- occur.
Here we explored a model in which the relative rate of vertical and oblique transmission fluctuates over time, either periodically or randomly. 
Comparing our results with previous results from a similar model with a fixed rate~\citep{Ram2018}, we find that $\ldots$ (to be continued) % TODO
%Specifically, if fluctuations are not small then a single phenotype is likely to fix in the population~(\autoref{eq:poly_condition_periodic_fluc}, \autoref{fig:rho1_rho2_k=1}, \autoref{fig:rho1_rho2_stoch_p}), and 

One caveat of our model is the use of the ``phenotypic gambit'' -- the assumption that the transmission mode itself is strictly vertically transmitted.
Although there is evidence that the tendency to use different learning mechanisms is genetically transmitted~\citep{Foucaud2013}, this assumption can be challenged: individuals may be able to learn how and when to learn, in what has been called ``social learning of social learning''~\citep{Mesoudi2016}.
Indeed, it has been demonstrated that guppy fish are more likely to learn from others if previous social experiences provided benefits~\citep{Leris2016}.
It is also possible that the transmission mode is regulated.
For example, \citet{Farine2015} found that zebra fish switch from vertical to oblique transmission after exposure to stress hormones.
Our model accounts for cases in which the entire population changes its transmission mode due to stress, but not for cases in which only some individuals do so.

An extension of our model could incorporate more sophisticated oblique transmission schemes.
For example, conformity -- preference for learning a frequent phenotype -- has been demonstrated in wild monkeys~\citep{VanDeWaal2013} and birds~\citep{Aplin2015}.
We suggest that the specific mode of oblique transmission can also fluctuate over time, so that individuals can, for example, conform to the frequent phenotype under benign conditions, and prefer a rare phenotype under stressful conditions.
Additional work will be required to understand how such fluctuations affect the population dynamics.
