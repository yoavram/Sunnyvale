**Fig. 1. Cultural transmission with mixed vertical and oblique transmission.** When a newborn matures, 
she copies the phenotype—color—of her mother with probability ρ, therefore becoming blue, 
or from some other female with probability 1-ρ, 
in which case her color will depend on the frequency of blue and red adult females.
